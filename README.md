# ASP.NET STARTER REPO
- using content from [`Microsoft Learn`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/getting-started/?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=windows)

<br>

1. Checked out the [`overview of ASP.NET Core`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-7.0) and what makes it "cool" .
    - > well from what i've seen, i gotta say, it lives up to its reputation, it has good stuff for many types of apps and implementations.

2. Then moved on to [`Core fundamentals Overview`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=windows) to checkout what to know before diving to the section i came here for which is MVC in ASP.NET 
    - > That was quite good, i loved the dependency injection, especially after appreciating it from learning [`springboot`](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) -> [`spring.io`](https://spring.io/).
    - > liked the error handling and the good folder structure.

3. Finally, now lets get to the main event, [`Getting Started with MVC`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-7.0&tabs=visual-studio) 
    - > Welp, turns out i need to generate another codebase for the MVC, let me have some fun with `Blazor` then move on to next one.
